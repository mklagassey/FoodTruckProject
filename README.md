# Food Truck Project

## ---Overview---
An app that stores all 5 (or less) food trucks you can think of, along with all their most salient features like what they serve, their rating and even their name! Power users will appreciate the ability to easily perform advanced operations like calculating the average score of all trucks or simply finding the truck with their highest rating.

### Technology used:
-Java -Conditionals -Looping -Input validation -Arrays -Eclipse

### Topics covered:
OOP: -Encapsulation -Abstraction -Classes -Objects

### Lessons learned:
A lot of time was spent trying to understand why we would instantiate an object within its own class. Still mulling that one. But definitely have a better grasp of the relationship and uses of field variables, both static and not. Also discovered that if all we need to do is display data from an array, there's no need to put it into another appropriately sized array first. Lastly, the importance of input validation is increasingly apparent.

### To Do
1) Figure out how to stop input with a space (i.e. - more than one word) from causing skipping problems in getTruckInfo loop
2) Add feature to display trucks by rating rank
3) Refactor, refactor, refactor
